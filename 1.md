You are tasked with writing a command line tool that simulates a math game for your young cousin 
It should ask following questions:
- an answer to an operation between integers A and B or
- which operation is missing from currenct calculation
-only implement for positive integers up to 100, no negative numbers
-all dvision must have a result without rest value (A%B=0)

the task is to implement a game class (mathgame/game.py) which implements all of the above features. further you must implement a script mathgame/math_is_fun.py that allows your cousin to play the game. the script must tell him if hes correct or not, it should run until your cousin has reached the chosen number of correct answers. 
Furthermore there should be a nice interface printed to the console that contains information about what to do.







Grading
Everything above this line constitutes the program’s basic functionality and has to be correctly im-
plemented in order for you to pass the exam. It contributes 50/100 points to your total score. If there is
a small mistake (e.g. a typo) that prevents (part of) the program from properly running, no points will
be deducted.
Including the following additional features in your solution will give you the specified number of points
(partial points are of course possible):
• Implementing at least one meaningful getter and setter [10/100 Pts.]
• Products (names, prices, stocks) and change are loaded from a JSON file called products.json when
the program starts. When the program ends, the updated product stocks and the new change
are saved back to the file. See the section Example products.json for an example file. You may
implement the saving/loading inside the main.py file or inside of a class. [10/100 Pts.]
• Proper error handling (user input is checked and the program doesn’t crash or end on illegal
input/keyboard interrupt, the user is asked to re-enter illegal input instead of having to restart the
program) [10/100 Pts.]
• Implementing at least three meaningful tests as seen in the exercises [10/100 Pts.]
• The code is documented and well organized [5/100 Pts.]
• The presence of an AUTHORS, LICENSE and README file with meaningful content (README
file is not optional if you use other people’s code, see above) [5/100 Pts.]
• (Bonus) Meaningful implementation of the str method in at least one class [5 bonus Pts.]



Example run: 
This in an example run of the program, meant to give you an idea of what your solution could look like.
It implements all the basic functionality required to pass the exam.

>>> from game import Game

mygame = Game(3) arguemnt is the number of required correct answers

print(mygame)
you have answered 0 questions correctly out of 3

mygame._gameover()
false

mygame.calculation(5, *, 10, 45)
false

further funcs in class:
calculation correct
ask operation
ask result










Example project structure
This is an example for your folder structure, assuming that you implement everything in the additional
features list.
.
AUTHORS
LICENSE
main.py
other necessary python files
.json file (if necessary)
README
test.py



The only files that have to be present are
• main.py containing the main method for user input/output and, optionally, functions for load-
ing/saving .json file
• some file name.py containing your class(es)
• README in case you use other people’s code
