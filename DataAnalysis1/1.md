Mock exam for p4p
You are tasked with writing a command line tool that simulates a vending machine. This machine should
be able to stock an arbitrary number of products, each with its own name, price and available quantity.
Each product should be assigned a number such that, like with a real vending machine, the customer can
easily choose what to buy. Since the vending machine has to be able to hand out change, it should keep
track of how much change it currently has.
Furthermore, there should be a nice interface printed to the console that contains information about
product numbers, names, prices and stocks and that lets the user insert an arbitrary amount of money
and make a selection from the list of products. When the user chooses to buy a product, the vending
machine should perform all the necessary checks in order to ensure a valid purchase. Specifically, the
purchase is considered invalid whenever the customer
• provides too little money,
• provides too much money and the vending machine does not have enough change to hand out,
• chooses an item that is out of stock or
• chooses a non-existing product id.
In all of these cases, the customer should be notified of their mistake. Whenever a product is successfully
bought, the customer should be presented with their change and the product’s stock as well as the
machine’s available change should be updated. The vending machine should run indefinitely, meaning that
the program only ends when the user presses Ctrl+C, allowing customers to repeatedly make purchases.
Please refer to the section Example run in order to get an idea of what the program could look like.
For your implementation, you must use an object oriented approach. This means that, apart from a
main function that handles user input and output, all of the program’s logic must be contained in classes.
Important: Your main function must be inside of a file called main.py while any classes you write must
be in (a) different file(s).
Allowed/forbidden tools and material
You are permitted to use any online/offline resources you like, except
• Generative AIs like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.
• Communication with other people
Whenever you use someone else’s code and said code has more than one line, make a note in the README
file about where you found it (e.g. URL, book, script, etc.)

Grading
Everything above this line constitutes the program’s basic functionality and has to be correctly im-
plemented in order for you to pass the exam. It contributes 50/100 points to your total score. If there is
a small mistake (e.g. a typo) that prevents (part of) the program from properly running, no points will
be deducted.
Including the following additional features in your solution will give you the specified number of points
(partial points are of course possible):
• Implementing at least one meaningful getter and setter [10/100 Pts.]
• Products (names, prices, stocks) and change are loaded from a JSON file called products.json when
the program starts. When the program ends, the updated product stocks and the new change
are saved back to the file. See the section Example products.json for an example file. You may
implement the saving/loading inside the main.py file or inside of a class. [10/100 Pts.]
• Proper error handling (user input is checked and the program doesn’t crash or end on illegal
input/keyboard interrupt, the user is asked to re-enter illegal input instead of having to restart the
program) [10/100 Pts.]
• Implementing at least three meaningful tests as seen in the exercises [10/100 Pts.]
• The code is documented and well organized [5/100 Pts.]
• The presence of an AUTHORS, LICENSE and README file with meaningful content (README
file is not optional if you use other people’s code, see above) [5/100 Pts.]
• (Bonus) Meaningful implementation of the str method in at least one class [5 bonus Pts.]
Example run
This in an example run of the program, meant to give you an idea of what your solution could look like.
It implements all the basic functionality required to pass the exam.
